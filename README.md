Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Smart Room Environment Control (IoT + AI)

For Hospitality Management (Health-Optimized Room Automation)

    Document Overview 1.1 Purpose

This PRD outlines the development of an AI-driven IoT system that dynamically adjusts hotel room conditions (temperature, lighting, air quality) to accommodate guests with chronic health conditions (e.g., arthritis, asthma, migraines), enhancing comfort while reducing symptom triggers.
1.2 Key Objectives

‚úî Automatically optimize room environments for guests‚Äô health needs.
‚úî Improve sleep quality and overall guest satisfaction.
‚úî Reduce energy waste via adaptive climate control.
‚úî Ensure real-time monitoring and proactive adjustments.
2. Product Scope
2.1 Features & Functionality
Feature	Description	User Benefit
Condition-Specific Presets	Auto-sets room parameters based on disclosed health needs (e.g., warmer temps for arthritis).	Eliminates manual adjustments.
Real-Time Air Quality Control	AI detects PM2.5/VOCs; triggers purifiers or ventilation for asthma/allergies.	Reduces respiratory triggers.
Migraine Mode	Dims lights, activates noise-canceling window buffers, and sets optimal humidity.	Prevents headache exacerbation.
Guest Override Options	Manual controls via app/voice (e.g., "Set to migraine mode").	Balances automation with personal choice.
Energy Efficiency Reports	Tracks HVAC optimization savings for sustainability goals.	Lowers operational costs.
2.2 Out of Scope

‚ùå Medical-grade air filtration (e.g., HEPA for immunocompromised).
‚ùå Integration with personal medical devices (e.g., CPAP machines).
‚ùå Diagnosing health conditions.
3. User Stories & Workflows
3.1 Guest Journey

Pre-Check-In:

    Guest selects health preferences during booking (e.g., "I have asthma" ‚Üí "Enable air quality monitoring").

    Room pre-configures to 22¬∞C, 45% humidity, and air purifier on.

During Stay:

    Asthma Trigger Detected: AI detects rising pollen levels ‚Üí purifier fan speed increases.

    Migraine Mode Activated: Guest says, "Hey Hotel, I have a headache" ‚Üí lights dim to 10%, blackout curtains close.

Check-Out:

    System resets to baseline; data anonymized for analytics.

3.2 Staff Workflow

Maintenance Alerts: Notified if IoT devices malfunction (e.g., purifier filter replacement).

Emergency Overrides: Staff can manually adjust rooms for guests unable to use apps (e.g., elderly).

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Tech Stack
Component	Technology	Purpose
IoT Sensors	Temperature (DHT22), Air Quality (Sensirion SPS30), Noise (Decibel X)	Real-time environment monitoring.
AI/ML Models	Reinforcement Learning (RL) for HVAC optimization, LSTM for predictive adjustments	Learns guest preferences over time.
Backend	AWS IoT Core, Node-RED for device management	Handles sensor data streams.
Frontend	React Native (guest app), Amazon Alexa/Google Home	Voice/UI controls.
Actuators	Smart thermostats (Nest), Philips Hue lights, Dyson purifiers	Execute AI commands.
4.2 Data & Compliance

üîí Encryption: MQTT with TLS for IoT communication.
üìú Compliance: GDPR (guest data), ENERGY STAR (HVAC efficiency).
üîÑ Data Retention: Anonymize after checkout; retain only aggregate trends.
5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

üå°Ô∏è Guest Comfort Score: Post-stay survey ratings (target: 4.5/5).
‚ö° Energy Savings: % reduction in HVAC usage vs. static settings.
üõ†Ô∏è Device Reliability: Uptime of IoT sensors (target: 99.9%).
6. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Over-automation (guests prefer manual control).	Opt-in automation + easy override options.
Sensor inaccuracies (e.g., false VOC readings).	Multi-sensor validation + quarterly recalibration.
Privacy concerns (room occupancy tracking).	Explicit consent for motion/voice data collection.
7. Roadmap

Phase 1 (4 months): Deploy IoT sensors + basic climate automation in 10 rooms.
Phase 2 (8 months): Integrate RL for predictive adjustments (e.g., pre-warm room at 6 AM for arthritis).
Phase 3 (12 months): Voice AI integration ("Adjust room for my arthritis").
Approval

Stakeholders:

Chief Engineer (IoT Deployment)

Guest Experience Director (Comfort Testing)

Data Privacy Officer (Compliance)
